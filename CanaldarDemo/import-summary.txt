ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* AndroidManifest.xml
* device-2014-11-15-004408.png
* proguard-project.txt
* res\
* res\drawable-hdpi\
* res\drawable-hdpi\ic_launcher.png
* res\drawable-mdpi\
* res\drawable-mdpi\ic_launcher.png
* res\drawable-xhdpi\
* res\drawable-xhdpi\ic_launcher.png
* res\values-v11\
* res\values-v11\styles.xml
* res\values-v14\
* res\values-v14\styles.xml
* res\values\
* res\values\strings.xml
* res\values\styles.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* src\ => monthView\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
